See the [`sdl3-sys`](sdl3-sys) dir for the SDL 3 Rust bindings.

- [`sdl3-sys`](sdl3-sys): Rust bindings for SDL 3
- [`sdl3-src`](sdl3-src): Source code crate for SDL 3, used by `sdl3-sys` when building from source.
  This contains the official SDL repository as a git submodule.
- [`sdl3-sys-gen`](sdl3-sys-gen): Parser and generator that generates `sdl3-sys` from the official SDL 3 headers.
- [`sdl3-main`](sdl3-main): Tools for using SDL's main and callback APIs.
- [`sdl3-main-macros`](sdl3-main-macros): Proc-macros for `sdl3-main`.
- [`sdl3-image-sys`](sdl3-image-sys): Rust bindings for SDL3_image
- [`sdl3-image-src`](sdl3-image-src): Source code crate for SDL3_image
- [`sdl3-ttf-sys`](sdl3-ttf-sys): Rust bindings for SDL3_ttf
- [`sdl3-ttf-src`](sdl3-ttf-src): Source code crate for SDL3_ttf
- [`examples`](examples): Rust ports of SDL GPU examples

### Why not use bindgen?

Because we can do better. `sdl3-sys-gen` makes platform independent bindings with full documentation
from the original headers and collects the output into modules. The generator is standalone.

## Higher-level bindings

If you prefer to work with more rusty and higher level constructs instead of the direct FFI bindings
in this crate you may want to take a look at:
