//! SDL offers touch input, on platforms that support it. It can manage
//! multiple touch devices and track multiple fingers on those devices.
//!
//! Touches are mostly dealt with through the event system, in the
//! [`SDL_EVENT_FINGER_DOWN`], [`SDL_EVENT_FINGER_MOTION`], and [`SDL_EVENT_FINGER_UP`]
//! events, but there are also functions to query for hardware details, etc.
//!
//! The touch system, by default, will also send virtual mouse events; this can
//! be useful for making a some desktop apps work on a phone without
//! significant changes. For apps that care about mouse and touch input
//! separately, they should ignore mouse events that have a `which` field of
//! [`SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID`].
