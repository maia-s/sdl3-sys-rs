//! CPU feature detection for SDL.
//!
//! These functions are largely concerned with reporting if the system has
//! access to various SIMD instruction sets, but also has other important info
//! to share, such as system RAM size and number of logical CPU cores.
//!
//! CPU instruction set checks, like [`SDL_HasSSE()`] and [`SDL_HasNEON()`], are
//! available on all platforms, even if they don't make sense (an ARM processor
//! will never have SSE and an x86 processor will never have NEON, for example,
//! but these functions still exist and will simply return false in these
//! cases).
